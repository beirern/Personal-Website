    p Hello! I'm a passionate developer who loves building things with code. This blog is where I share my projects, and what I've learned along the way. You will also find random posts about philosophy and my other thoughts.
    p My main areas of interest include:
    ul
      li System Architecture: going from code on your laptop to others!
      li Containerization (Docker & Kubernetes)
      li Running things on a Unix Server
      li Random fun projects!
    br
    p When I'm not coding, you can find me doing jiu-jitsu, muay thai, cycling, playing sports, flying planes or philosophizing! At least this is what I was doing in San Francisco :)
    p Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or have any questions about my projects or thoughts!
