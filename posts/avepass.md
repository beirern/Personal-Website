excerpt: When I was at the University of Washington I had the opportunity to work with some friends on a startup app that offered food delivery. It ended up dying and I made no money, so why did I do it, what did I learn, and would I do it again?

It's 2019: I am in college at the University of Washington without a major declared and a pipe dream of getting into the computer science program. I knew I wanted to go into Software Engineering but wasn't able to get into the program directly out of high school. I was in the same position as literally hundreds of other students competing for the handful of spots that were left for students looking to transfer into the program. I didn't have any projects under my belt, just code from classwork and my GPA was good but in such a competitive environment not good enough to be confident about getting into the program. What to do?

I began looking into projects, keep in mind that what you learn in computer science classes (especially the intro classes) is very basic and generally only helpful if you're given an extremely specific problem and only trying to solve it on your computer. No one tells you how to manage a full project, 3rd party packages/dependencies, and most importantly how to actually distribute your work, whether it's a website or an executable.

Enter [Ginsu Eddy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ginsu-eddy/), a friend of mine from high school that had recently joined a group of upperclassmen UW students who were working on a project to take orders and deliver food from nearby restaurants on University Avenue to campus. The project was called [avepass](https://www.linkedin.com/company/avepass/posts/?feedView=all). He said that they were looking for developers to help out, no one was getting paid or making any money, it was just a group of guys learning and building a product.
