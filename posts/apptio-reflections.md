title: Reflections from my first Software Internship
date: 2025-02-04
tags: [Apptio, Internship]
excerpt: The summer of 2020 was a fascinating time, it was my first software internship/job and in the beginning of COVID as well when we were all inside. It was a huge learning experience and without my time at [Apptio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apptio-an-ibm-company/posts/?feedView=all) I'm not sure I would have swung my later internship and job.

# Reflection

It's interesting to think about life and the oppurtunities we had and where we would be without them. I look at the software engineering industry/space and it seems like Hell for new grads. Especially with AI, the skills that would have landed you an internship when I was in college is now completely obsolete. I literally learned software engineering through frameworks like react, being a framework engineer is what AI is best at so now the experience would be somewhat pointless.

In my 2nd year of college I was searching for an internship. I ended up applying to Apptio Inc. (now an IBM company<sup>TM</sup>). I don't remember how I found out about the company, it might have been just a cold application that somehow ended up with a response but I ended up interviewing for them.

# Getting the Internship

It was a pretty simple process, behavior -> in-person coding interview. The behavioral was with the recruiter and I remember how I looked up what Apptio did 15 minutes before the interview and I ended up asking lots of questions about the company. I don't remember anything else but I assume we talked about classwork and projects though at this point that would have been a very limited conversation.

The coding interview was in-person at their office. It was my first time in a software companies office, I had a job as a lifeguard and swim instructor at the local YMCA, but this would be my first job in industry. The office was nice and I was led into a room with an engineer. The problem was to create the HashMap object from scratch. I had actually done things like this before, i.e. implement Data Structures in the java standard library by hand, so this was actually pretty simple. I remember the interviewer was on their laptop the whole time and seemed to lose interest by the end (we've all been there) but I did solve the problem. At the end we talked a little about myself and something about the interviewer's son either being a swimmer or taking lessons at the YMCA. I'm very open during interviews, especially if the interview is in person, so finding commonalities with interviewers usually happens and I really do think it helps with passing them. Always try to get to know your interviewer if you have time during the interview.

About a week or two after the interview I got a call that said I didn't get the role. I was bummed, I really wanted an internship and thought I did well! I ended up writing a thank you email to the recruiter and the person who interviewed me and literally a day later the recruiter called me back and said they did have a spot open. I don't know if me going out of my way to say thank you did anything or if someone dropped out or what happened in the backend but I did get the interview and I think you should always followup and thank the interviewers and recruiter/coordinator if you can. Nonetheless, I was super excited. It was my first internship and as a college student who did not get into the Computer Science program it was validation that I could make it into the industry and give me a massive step up for an internship next year.
