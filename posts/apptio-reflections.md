title: Reflections from my first Software Internship
date: 2025-02-04
tags: [Apptio, Internship]
excerpt: The summer of 2020 was a fascinating time, it was my first software internship/job and in the beginning of COVID as well when we were all inside. It was a huge learning experience and without my time at [Apptio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apptio-an-ibm-company/posts/?feedView=all) I'm not sure I would have swung my later internship and job.
